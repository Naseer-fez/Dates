So this project is begin for Python but iam taking the help of Ctypes libary by which i can implement everthing underthe hood by 
a faster and realinat C.

Day-1
I have created the Nessacary requriments for the date , My main focus right now is to work on dates .
I have created the memory alloacation and date storage , the main problem i have faced is NAMING
which is quite funny , but i want to make this a production level project in which  i will work on this later down the time and also , i work with other people as well. 

Day-2 
THe plan for day 2 is to make the funtional calucltion , like finding what day it is , based on the year , after this , the plan is to add
the Default date modfier in which iam going to allote the date even if i dont get the right format and also the date validator.

Day-3
Faced a real logical and memory problem today, with C memory leak is a very well know problem ,i have countured the memory leak problem ,but i have found myself wondering in the Logical side of the things, i have to make a full rewamp in the logic of the date placemnts

Day-4
I have figured out the Logical error but i have realised that my initail methods were wrong , so the good news is that , i have to rewite only one single function , so that is the bets thing, but the bad news is that that is the main functions which will totaly makes this libary unique and comparetively different to other libarie.
Day -5
